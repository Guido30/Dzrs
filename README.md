Dzrs is a music downloader and metadata editor for flac files.

## Features

## Getting Started

Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Guido30/Dzrs/releases) page and download the prebuilt binary.

Linux support is not tested, tecnically it should work, but you would have build the executable yourself, which requires you to have knowledge of cargo and rust in general.

## Notice

Dzrs is a personal project, and while im happy to develop it, future updates and mantainance might not be guaranteed.  
If slavart decides to shut down their api or if it goes down one day, downloading tracks wont be a thing anymore.  
So feel free to open an issue or fork the project it ever stops working.
