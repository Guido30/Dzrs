## Description

If you have a local library of songs in FLAC format and want to update their tags using the deezer database tags (which i find to be pretty minimal and clutter free) then this program can do that.

Dzrs is a FLAC metadata editor, mainly focused on retrieving tags from deezer and applying them to songs, public api and undocumented deezer endpoints are used for retrieving tags, the undocumented endpoints contains lyrics which are not available through their public api.  
Manually editing the tags also works but you are limited to only editing tags already present in the files, and cannot add new ones
